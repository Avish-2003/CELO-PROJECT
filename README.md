# ðŸ§  BlockNote

A simple **decentralized private notes app** built with **Solidity** â€” where your notes belong **only to you**.  
Each user can securely store and retrieve personal notes on the blockchain.

## ðŸª¶ Project Description

**BlockNote** is a lightweight smart contract designed for people who want to keep personal notes in a decentralized way.  
Every wallet address has its own set of private notes â€” meaning your data is stored **only under your account** and cannot be viewed or edited by others.

This project demonstrates how decentralized storage can be used for privacy-oriented personal tools.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Lets each user **store**, **retrieve**, and **count** their personal notes.  
- Every note is linked only to the userâ€™s wallet address.  
- The contract ensures **ownership isolation** â€” no one can read another user's notes.  

> ðŸ§© This is a great starting point for learning Solidity, mappings, and event emission.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… **Per-User Storage:**  
Each Ethereum (or Celo) address stores its own independent notes.

âœ… **Note Events:**  
Emits an event every time a new note is added â€” great for front-end integration.

âœ… **Simple API:**  
Just 3 main functions:
- `addNote(string memory _note)`
- `getMyNotes()`
- `getMyNoteCount()`

âœ… **Gas-Efficient:**  
Clean, minimal logic for low transaction cost.

âœ… **Fully On-Chain:**  
All data is stored directly on the blockchain (no central server).
